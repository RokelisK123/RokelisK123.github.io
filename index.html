                    <h3>project 1</h3>
                    <p>in this project, I created a model that helps identify pneumonia from X-ray images. using a large dataset from Kaggle, 
                        I was able to train the model and then test the model using Streamlit. Building this project helped me gain experience 
                        and knowledge with TensorFlow Keras, test CNN like ResNet, learn about all the filters and layers as fundamentals in making those type of models.</p>

                    <h3>project 2</h3>
                    <p>in this project, I created a finance tracking app, that's connected 
                        with the database, meaning any user has its own login/password that helps keep the finances in track whenever you login. 
                        I took an extra C# course in university, which help me develop an understanding of how it works and what you are able to build using it. 
                        Not only I was able to make something useful and practical, I also gained some experience in game making using Unity and testing my abilities with C#.</p>

                    <p>in this project, I built a model that recognizes different objects in the picture. 
                        the model was able to locate the objects inside the picture and place a hotmap indicating where the model thinks the object is.
                        I've also used these skills to make projects like food label recognition and object detection in the video.

                    <p>in this project, I built a model that recognizes different animals in the picture. 
                        using the famous cifar-100 dataset, I was able to make the model predict what kind of animal is in the picture. 
                        With this project, I was able to learn how to use the dataset and how to train the model using TensorFlow Keras.

                    <h3>project 5</h3>
                    <p>in this project, I built a website, using my skills of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
                        I've had several courses of frontend and it really pushed me to try and make beautiful designs and websites. 
                        I also learned how to use Wordpress and how to make a real website using it, creating 45laipsniai.lt page.
                        I was able to learn how to use the plugins and how to make the website look good and functional.

                    <h3>project 6</h3>
                    <p>in this project, I've showcased some of my NLP skills (Natural Language Processing). 
                        I created a text summarizer, a rhyme maker, and also performed sentiment analysis. I've also tried creating
                         Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (GPT) model,
                        which is a type of language model that uses deep learning to produce human-like text.
                        I used libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and tqdm and open datasets from Kaggle or other sources.
                        By doing these projects and learning about NLP, I was able to gain a better understanding of how to work with text data, RegEx, deep in to different methods and algorithms,
                         and how to use different libraries to perform various NLP tasks.

                    <h3>project 7</h3>
                    <p>in this project, I focused on big data analysis using the Apache Spark RDD API. 
                    I tackled various tasks such as analyzing shipment weights by groups, exploring the interaction between routes and geographic zones, 
                    and examining customer and shipment flows on different days of the week. 
                    This project allowed me to apply Spark's capabilities in practice, optimize data processing time, and 
                    compare the results with a MapReduce solution. This work strengthened my ability to work with large datasets 
                    and effectively apply analytical methods in real-world scenarios.
